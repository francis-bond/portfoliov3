        Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Francis Bond and I have recently become a web developer.
        Full stack web developer with a Certificate in Full Stack Web Development from the
        University of Texas Bootcamp, where I gained skills in JavaScript, CSS, HTML and React.js. I
        am a detailed oriented coder who has contributed to past projects by finding ways to write
        efficient code. For example, I helped classmates identify bugs in their code and was
        consistently approached by project teammates to help break down steps needed to get our code
        functional.

        My last project was an interactive image annotator tool for scholars to share
        information. In our team of five, I was responsible for learning and implementing a new
        technology to upload images and store them to our database. A tool to easily share
        information through annotations that will be used in a meeting of scholars. Iâ€™m excited to
        leverage my skills and knowledge as part of a team to build and improve applications.
